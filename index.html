  Hello World

<p>Welcome to my site!</p>

<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML is cool</li>
<li>CSS is cooler</li>
<li>JS is the best</li>
</ul>

What do you need to create a website?
</head2>

Not much!
<li2>
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
</li2>

<p>Follow my progress on github</p>
